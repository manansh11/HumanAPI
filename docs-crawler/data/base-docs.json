If the\ntiming of your transaction is flexible, you can save costs by submitting\ntransactions during periods of lower gas on the L1 (for example, over the\nweekend)\n\nSimilarly, the L2 fee can increase and decrease depending on how many\ntransactions are being submitted to the L2. This adjustment mechanism has the\nsame implementation as the L1; you can read more about it\nhere.\n\nFor additional details about fee calculation on Base, please refer to the\nop-stack developer\ndocumentation."
